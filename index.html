          In the essay Emerson explains that to experience the wholeness with
          nature for which we are naturally suited, we must be separate from the
          flaws and distractions imposed on us by society. Emerson believed that
          solitude is the single mechanism through which we can be fully engaged
          in the world of nature, writing "To go into solitude, a man needs to
          retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary
          whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would
          be alone, let him look at the stars."[5] When a person experiences
          true solitude, in nature, it "take[s] him away". Society, he says,
          destroys wholeness, whereas "Nature, in its ministry to man, is not
          only the material, but is also the process and the result. All the
          parts incessantly work into each other's hands for the profit of man.

          animal; and thus the endless circulations of the divine charity

          Emerson uses spirituality as a major theme in the essay. Emerson
          believed in re-imagining the divine as something large and visible,
          which he referred to as nature; such an idea is known as
          transcendentalism, in which one perceives a new God and a new body,
          and becomes one with his or her surroundings. Emerson confidently
          exemplifies transcendentalism, stating, "From the earth, as a shore, I
          look out into that silent sea. I seem to partake its rapid
          transformations: the active enchantment reaches my dust, and I dilate
          and conspire with the morning wind",[8] postulating that humans and
          wind are one. Emerson referred to nature as the "Universal Being"; he
          believed that there was a spiritual sense of the natural world around
          him. Depicting this sense of "Universal Being", Emerson states, "The
          aspect of nature is devout. Like the figure of Jesus, she stands with
          bended head, and hands folded upon the breast. The happiest man is he
          who learns from nature the lesson of worship".[9] According to
          Emerson, there were three spiritual problems addressed about nature
          for humIn the essay Emerson explains that to experience the wholeness with
          nature for which we are naturally suited, we must be separate from the
          flaws and distractions imposed on us by society. Emerson believed that
          solitude is the single mechanism through which we can be fully engaged

          be alone, let him look at the stars."[5] When a person experiences
          true solitude, in nature, it "take[s] him away". Society, he says,
          destroys wholeness, whereas "Nature, in its ministry to man, is not

          parts incessantly work into each other's hands for the profit of man.
